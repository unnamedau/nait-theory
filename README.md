# NAIT Theory Plover Dictionary
This is an edit of Plover's default dictionary to align with NAIT theory, for use at home instead of paying for a CaseCat subscription.
## Requirements
plover-retro-format (to emulate CaseCat number formatting for `TOIM` and `FOIM`)
## Changes
Plover does not allow for one outline to do both initial and final quote -- you can either leave `KW-T` as is (and have spaces around both sides of the quote to clean up later) or use default Plover `KW-GS` (initial) and `KR-GS` (final). \
(At the time of writing, you will be docked marks on your notes if you use `KW-GS`/`KR-GS` on tests. Be careful, learn both!)\
You will have to `TOIM`  more often than the official CC dictionary -- immediate triggers like `A*PL`, `P*PL`, and `TPH/-T/TPHORPB/-G` work, but not words before the time (and you'll always have to `FOIM`).
## Other info
If you beg Joanne and Keegan enough, they might let you have the full dictionary early, in which case *don't use this*, convert it to RTF in class and then use that in Plover\
Starting from L16, I started making [TypeyType custom lessons](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16WSkTaG9Wiuq0ux_AsEWh4CqJIoL5WrulV2tiQBU_R4/edit?usp=sharing) that you're more than welcome to use to practice. Select all, then Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V into TypeyType.
